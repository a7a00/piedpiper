Pied Piper
=========

I figured I'd start working on something before I head off to college. (Also, my friends are all working on cool stuff, and I want in.) So I figured that it would be fun to start working on a compression algorithm!

Pied Piper is going to be an evolutionarily created algorithm, made with genetic programming. Most of the heavy evolution code will probably be in C/C++.

The name "Pied Piper" and the concept of a compression algorithm were shamelessly taken from HBO's brilliant new series "[Silicon Valley](http://www.hbo.com/silicon-valley)". Seriously, watch it, it's incredible. Also, this is going to be the first major project (other than my website) that I'm working on with GitHub, so please excuse any stupid commit names, etc.

I really hope this becomes something awesome. I'll be working on it over the weekend. Please check back! I'm leaving updates in the UPDATES.md file.
