God God, am I exhausted, and it's only 9:15. I got a lot of work done at CodeDay NY, and had a lot of fun, but it was the easy part. As of now I've laid everything out. As for the two basic algorithms I have, one has been borrowed wholesale, and I got so much help on the other one, I've barely written it. So, from here on out, I'm not going to use any code from online. I want this to be my own effort.

Also, I have to leave this thing early because parents and I spent a lot of time here playing video games, so sorry about there being less work in this commit than you'd expect from a hackathon.

Until next time!
