These files contain implementations of the basic compression algorithms used:
 *wilt-compressor
 *Arithmetic Coding
 *Lempel-Ziv-Welch Compression
 *PPMD
 *Run-Length Encoding
 *LZ4
 *SMAZ

...Jesus Christ, I spent an hour choosing these. What the hell is my life?
Also, make sure each file has a header AND a C++ file in it, numnuts.
