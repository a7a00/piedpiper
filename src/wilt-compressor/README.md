This code comes from [these fine people](https://code.google.com/u/102828681101881323870/). I've tried to reverse engineer it, but I'm way too exhausted to, at the moment, and I probably am going to have to leave CodeDay NYC early, which sucks. Excuses aside, I should really come back to this later. The code in this folder is liscensed by its original creatos under the [MIT License](http://opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php).
