To Do
=========================

All righty, I did not get as much done during the 2-3 hours I spent at CodeDay NYC as I would have liked, so here's the way forward for the forseeable future:
- [ ] Finish the basic compression algorithms. (ACTUALLY WRITE THE DAMN THINGS YOURSELF.)
 - [x] Add a .h file to the lzw module.
 - [ ] Give all files MATCHING run methods. (Must accept the same parameters. What those parameters are is still undetermined.)
- [ ] Finifh the master compressor, decompressor and evolver code.

Aside from that, there really doesn't seem to be much left. Let's see how long it takes me to complete this thing.

Until next time!
